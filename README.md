JTS is an open-source library that provides a complete and flexible set of tools for working with geometric objects in Java. It supports 2D and some basic 3D geometry operations. JTS is widely used in the GIS community and can be a good choice for computational geometry tasks in Java.

A Voronoi diagram is a geometric structure that partitions a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of points called "sites" or "generators". Each region in the Voronoi diagram contains all the points that are closer to a particular site than to any other site. In other words, it creates a set of polygons, where each polygon represents the area closest to a specific site.

Voronoi diagrams have diverse applications, including computer graphics, computational geometry, spatial analysis in geography, network design, and more.

Beyond their practical applications, Voronoi diagrams are aesthetically interesting and often used in art and design due to their visually appealing and intricate patterns.

This is a beginner project that I aimed to do to explore JTS and the vast world of Computational Geometry.

A refresh button is provided to regenerate sites and regions. A slider is integrated to play around with the number of sites.
